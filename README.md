Welcome to my Python code for solving the Knight's Tour puzzle!

The code uses the following Python packages:
numpy, matplotlib

Launch the code from from the command line by running run.py (without animation) 
or animate.py (with animation, but considerably slower) with python interpreter.

In run.py or animate.py, some settings can be adjusted:
-starting point
-max number of steps to try
-grid size (along side)

To turn warnsdorf's rule for picking the path on/off, there is a toggle in 
the file knights_tour.py, in the function definition of get_moves(), by setting 
the argument warnsdorf=True/False.
